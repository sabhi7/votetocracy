					H.R 1965 would change how the Bureau of Land Management(BLM) regulates oil and gas development on federal lands in order to streamline
					the regulatory process and make energy production easier on these lands.

						<div id="bco" class="hide p-t-sm">
							The Federal Lands Jobs and Energy Security Act (H.R. 1965) is designed to provide energy permitting and leasing certainty for oil and natural gas companies, and particularly as it relates to shale oil development.The bill is a response to criticisms from the oil and gas industry that federal permitting and leasing processes have hindered development on federal lands. In particularlylar, it amends required environmental reviews, mandates federal leasing programs, and facilitates shale oil development on federal lands.

						<div id="wsf" class="hide p-t-sm">
							H.R 1965 would directly affect the Bureau of Land Management and oil and natural gas companies by increasing both permitting fees and access to federal lands for development. The BLM would have to offer for sale at least 25 percent of onshore federal lands nominated by firms for oil and gas leasing, as well as create a commercial leasing program for oil shale resources on federal lands. The legislation would also affect groups protesting leases, rights of way, or permit applications due to a $4,000 documentation fee that would be required for filing such applications.
